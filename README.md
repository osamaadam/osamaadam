# Hello, World! :wave:

You'll find here, a meriad of projects I've worked on, and some I'm currently working on.

A personal favourite of mine is [cfgrr](https://github.com/osamaadam/cfgrr), a GNU stow inspired configuration manager.

Sometimes I write rather personal revelations on my blog at [osamaadam.me/blog](https://osamaadam.me/blog) (I haven't actually wrote anything in a while :clown_face:), whose source code you may find [here](https://github.com/osamaadam/personal-website).
